# TI-99-4a-Unit-Test
A unit testing framework for Assembly Language on the TI-99/4a

The TI-99/4a contained the TMS9900 as its CPU. I have interest in writing assembly code as a hobby. Even assembly programs can be broken down into small enough units that the units can be auto tested, and I hope to eventually use this library in order to run such test.
